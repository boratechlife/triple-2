    FAQ:
      - title: How does the AI minute-taking software work?
        description: >-
          tripleblueAIâ„¢ operates by utilizing artificial intelligence that, based on the audio file and associated context documents, creates a fully elaborated set of minutes. Based on your own template and style preferences, a high-quality set of minutes is produced with all important points, action items, and identified decisions. The software is also capable of recognizing different speakers and documenting their contributions separately, ensuring a clear and structured minute-taking process.
      - title: What is artificial intelligence, also called "AI"?
        description: >-
          Artificial intelligence, often abbreviated as "AI" (from the English "Artificial Intelligence"), refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. This includes activities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and understanding language.

          At its core, AI consists of algorithms, complex sets of rules and instructions that enable machines to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with some degree of autonomy. This technology is applied in various sectors, ranging from simple tasks such as recommendation systems in online stores to complex applications like self-driving cars, advanced medical diagnoses, and, as in your case, improving business processes through AI-driven minute-taking software.
      - title: How long does it take to receive the minutes?
        description: >-
          If the audio file is delivered today, you will receive the elaborated minutes tomorrow. That is our goal. As soon as the audio file and context documents are provided, we always try to deliver the minutes within 24 hours. Depending on your wishes, such as an extra quality check, the quality of the audio, and the quality of the meeting structure, this can take up to a maximum of 5 working days. We always make clear agreements in advance and share any issues transparently and timely with you. Should there be problems with the quality of the audio recordings, we are happy to help you improve them.
      - title: How do I receive the elaborated minutes?
        description: >-
          Once the minutes have been elaborated by our AI minute-taking software, they are standardly available in our web application. You can easily consult, adjust, or download the elaborated minutes by logging into your account in our web application.

          We know that many organizations use management software. Therefore, we are always open to a discussion about how we can integrate the minutes directly into your own management software. This way, we can look together for a solution that best fits your specific needs and workflows, to further optimize usability and efficiency.
      - title: What is the price?
        description: >-
          The price of our AI minute-taking service is based on the number of audio hours of your meetings and is settled per audio hour. The final costs depend on your specific wishes and the volume of meetings you want to have minuted.

          In determining the price, we consider factors such as the desired style of the minutes and whether you need an extra quality control by our own minute-takers. A more detailed, specific style or the use of an extra quality control can lead to a higher price per audio hour, given the additional time and resources required for this.

          We offer a flexible pricing structure that can be adjusted to your needs and budget. For a detailed quote, we invite you to contact us, so we can discuss your specific requirements and wishes and propose a tailor-made offer.

      - title: Can I integrate it into my existing management software?
        description: >-
          Although we currently do not support integrations with existing management software (such as Twinq and Convect), we aim to offer this possibility in the future. However, we do provide minutes in the desired format, so they can be easily transferred to various software systems.

          We understand that smooth integration is essential for efficiency and ease of use. Our team is ready to work with you on a seamless integration into your workflows. Do not hesitate to contact us to discuss your specific needs, so we can find a solution that best fits your organization.
      - title: What is the difference with classic transcription software?
        description: >-
          The difference between our AI minute-taking software and classic transcription software lies mainly in the intelligence and functionality focused on minute elaboration. While traditional transcription software limits itself to converting speech to text, our AI-driven software goes a step further by understanding the context and core of the meeting.

          Our software is specifically designed not only to transcribe words but also to identify important points, decisions, and action items. This means that the software can recognize the structure of a meeting, such as the distinction between different speakers, agenda items, and discussions. Moreover, our software can automatically structure and format the minutes, resulting in a clear, concise, and immediately usable document.

          In short, our AI minute-taking software offers a more advanced, intelligent, and customized solution for elaborating minutes, as opposed to the basic transcription functions of classic software. This results in a significant saving of time and effort in processing meeting data.
