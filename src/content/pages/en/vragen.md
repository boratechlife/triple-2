    FAQ:
      - title: How does the AI minute-taking software work?
        description: >-
          tripleblueAIâ„¢ operates by utilizing artificial intelligence to create fully detailed minutes based on the audio file and accompanying contextual documents. Based on your own template and writing style preferences, high-quality minutes are prepared with all key points, action items, and identified decisions. The software is also capable of recognizing different speakers and documenting their contributions separately, ensuring clear and structured minute-taking.
      - title: What is artificial intelligence, also known as "AI"?
        description: >-
          Artificial intelligence, often abbreviated as "AI" (from the English "Artificial Intelligence"), refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes activities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.


          At its core, AI consists of algorithms, complex sets of rules and instructions that enable machines to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with some degree of autonomy. This technology is applied in various sectors, ranging from simple tasks like recommendation systems in online stores to complex applications such as self-driving cars, advanced medical diagnoses, and, as in your case, improving business processes through AI-driven minute-taking software.
      - title: How long does it take to receive minutes?
        description: >-
          If the audio file is delivered today, you will receive the finalized minutes tomorrow. That is our goal. Once the audio file and contextual documents are provided, we always strive to deliver the minutes within 24 hours. Depending on your preferences such as an additional quality check, the quality of the audio, and the quality of the meeting structure, this may take up to a maximum of 5 working days. We always make clear agreements in advance and, should any issues arise, we share them with you transparently and in a timely manner. If there are issues with the quality of the audio recordings, we are happy to help improve them.
      - title: How do I receive the finalized minutes?
        description: >-
          Once the minutes are generated by our AI minute-taking software, they are readily available in our web application by default. You can easily access, modify, or download the finalized minutes by logging into your account in our web application.


          We understand that many organizations use management software. Therefore, we are always open to discussing how we can integrate the minutes directly into your existing management software. This way, we can work together to find a solution that best suits your specific needs and workflows, further optimizing usability and efficiency.
      - title: What is the pricing?
        description: >-
          The price of our AI minute-taking service is based on the number of audio hours of your meetings and is charged per audio hour. The final costs depend on your specific requirements and the volume of meetings you want to have minuted.


          In pricing, we take factors into account such as the desired writing style of the minutes and whether you require an additional quality check by our own minute-takers. A more detailed, specific writing style or the deployment of an additional quality check may result in a higher price per audio hour, given the additional time and resources required.


          We offer a flexible pricing structure that can be tailored to your needs and budget. For a detailed price quote, we invite you to contact us so that we can discuss your specific requirements and preferences and propose a customized offer.

      - title: Can I integrate it into my existing management software?
        description: >-
          Although we currently do not support integrations with existing management software (such as Twinq and Convect), we aim to provide this possibility in the future. However, we do provide minutes in the desired format, making it easy to transfer them to various software systems.


          We understand that smooth integration is essential for efficiency and usability. Our team is ready to work with you on a seamless integration into your workflows. Feel free to contact us to discuss your specific needs so that we can find a solution that best suits your organization.
      - title: What is the difference with classical transcription software?
        description: >-
          The difference between our AI minute-taking software and classical transcription software lies primarily in the intelligence and functionality focused on minute-taking. While traditional transcription software is limited to converting speech to text, our AI-driven software goes further by understanding the context and core of the meeting.


          Our software is specifically designed to transcribe not only words but also to identify key points, decisions, and action items. This means that the software can recognize the structure of a meeting, such as distinguishing between different speakers, agenda items, and discussions. Moreover, our software can automatically structure and format the minutes, resulting in a clear, concise, and immediately usable document.


          In short, our AI minute-taking software provides a more advanced, intelligent, and tailored solution for minute-taking, as opposed to the basic transcription functions of classical software. This results in significant time and effort savings in processing meeting data.
